         <p>A hacker is any person engaged in hacking.
                  The term hacking historically referred to constructive, clever technical work
                   that was not necessarily related to computer systems.
                    Today, however, hacking and hackers are most commonly associated
                     with malicious programming attacks on networks and computers over
                      the internet.</p>
